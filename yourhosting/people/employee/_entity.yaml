# At this moment, EVERY item type MUST have its own renderer. It SHOULD be possible to just define an item type
#  have the item-renderer be automatically connected by default.
# So for bonus: add the class:
# class Employee(ItemRenderer):
#    ...
# in the file sitekick/data/renderers/items/yourhosting/people.py
